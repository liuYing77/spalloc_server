    on SpiNNaker machines.

    Once constructed the server starts a background thread
    (:py:attr:`._server_thread`, :py:meth:`._run`) which implements the main
    server logic and handles communication with clients, monitoring of
    asynchronous board control events (e.g. board power-on completion) and
    watches the config file for changes. All members of this object are assumed
    to be accessed only from this thread while it is running. The thread is
    stopped, and its completion awaited by calling :py:meth:`.stop_and_join`,
    stopping the server.

    The server uses a :py:class:`~spalloc_server.Controller` object to
    implement scheduling, allocation and machine management functionality. This
    object is :py:mod:`pickled <pickle>` when the server shuts down in order to
    preserve the state of all managed machines (e.g. allocated jobs etc.).

    To allow the interruption of the server thread on asynchronous events from
    the Controller a :py:func:`~socket.socketpair` (:py:attr:`._notify_send`
    and :py:attr:`._notify_send`) is used which monitored along with client
    connections and config file changes.

    A number of callable commands are implemented by the server in the form of
    a subset of the :py:class:`.Server`'s methods indicated by the
    :py:func:`.spalloc_command` decorator. These may be called by a client by
    sending a line ``{"command": "...", "args": [...], "kwargs": {...}}``. If
    the function throws an exception, the client is disconnected. If the
    function returns, it is packed as a JSON line ``{"return": ...}``.

        Jobs for which no suitable machines are available are immediately

        Once a job has been created, it must be 'kept alive' by a simple
        watchdog_ mechanism. Jobs may be kept alive by periodically calling the
        :py:meth:`.job_keepalive` command or by calling any other job-specific
        command. Jobs are culled if no keep alive message is received for
        ``keepalive`` seconds. If absolutely necessary, a job's keepalive value
        may be set to None, disabling the keepalive mechanism.

        .. _watchdog: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer

        Once a job has been allocated some boards, these boards will be
        automatically powered on and left unbooted ready for use.

        Parameters
        ----------
        owner : str
            **Required.** The name of the owner of this job.
        keepalive : float or None, optional
            The maximum number of seconds which may elapse between a query on
            this job before it is automatically destroyed. If None, no timeout
            is used. (Default: 60.0)

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        machine : str or None, optional
            Specify the name of a machine which this job must be executed on.
            If None, the first suitable machine available will be used,
            according to the tags selected below. Must be None when tags are
            given. (Default: None)
        tags : [str, ...] or None, optional
            The set of tags which any machine running this job must have. If
            None is supplied, only machines with the "default" tag will be
            used. If machine is given, this argument must be None.
            (Default: None)
        min_ratio : float, optional
            The aspect ratio (h/w) which the allocated region must be 'at least
            as square as'. Set to 0.0 for any allowable shape, 1.0 to be
            exactly square. Ignored when allocating single boards or specific
            rectangles of triads.
        max_dead_boards : int or None, optional
            The maximum number of broken or unreachable boards to allow in the
            allocated region. If None, any number of dead boards is permitted,
            as long as the board on the bottom-left corner is alive (Default:
            None).
        max_dead_links : int or None, optional
            The maximum number of broken links allow in the allocated region.
            When require_torus is True this includes wrap-around links,
            otherwise peripheral links are not counted.  If None, any number of
            broken links is allowed. (Default: None).
        require_torus : bool, optional
            If True, only allocate blocks with torus connectivity. In general
            this will only succeed for requests to allocate an entire machine
            (when the machine is otherwise not in use!). Must be False when
            allocating boards. (Default: False)

            ``chip`` the coordinates of the chip, (x, y), if the whole machine
            were booted as a single machine.

            ``board_chip`` the coordinates of the chip, (x, y), within its

            ``job_chip`` the coordinates of the chip, (x, y), within its
            job, if a job is allocated to the board or None otherwise.
